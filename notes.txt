Some things I noticed while working with graphviz:
I was reading the man page for dot and I realized the different methods of creating graphs that graphiz has are the ones we read about in the research paper.
It's cool to utilize the methods the methods we just learned about even if we aren't coding them.
circo is my favorite of the ones I tried and it isn't spring based, but I thought patchwork was also a cool way to show tree maps.


tricks:
subgraphs to visually separate sets of points(only works well in dot)
polygons + distortion to create cool shapes
you can define broad categories. Reminds me of CSS
rankdir to specify directions
shape can be user defined
subdivide edges by creating fake vertices
you can use clustering
you can add images and add gradients
sfdp for large graphs
